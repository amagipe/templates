When the `self.my_var` variable in the `__init__` function is set to an instance of another class (e.g., `self.my_var = MyOtherClass()`), and you want to mock this variable, you typically mock the class (`MyOtherClass`) so that it returns a mock object when instantiated.

Here's how you can do it using `unittest.mock.patch`:

### Example Setup

Suppose you have the following classes:

```python
class MyOtherClass:
    def some_method(self):
        return 42

class MyClass:
    def __init__(self):
        self.my_var = MyOtherClass()

    def my_method(self):
        return self.my_var.some_method() * 2
```

### Mocking the Dependency (`MyOtherClass`)

You can mock `MyOtherClass` so that `self.my_var` in `MyClass` is set to a mock object:

```python
from unittest import TestCase
from unittest.mock import patch, MagicMock

class TestMyClass(TestCase):
    @patch('path.to.MyOtherClass')  # Replace 'path.to.MyOtherClass' with the actual import path
    def test_my_method(self, MockMyOtherClass):
        # Create a mock instance of MyOtherClass
        mock_instance = MockMyOtherClass.return_value
        mock_instance.some_method.return_value = 100  # Mock the method
        
        obj = MyClass()  # MyClass will use the mocked MyOtherClass
        result = obj.my_method()
        
        # Assert that the result is as expected
        self.assertEqual(result, 200)  # 100 * 2
        
        # Assert that some_method was called once
        mock_instance.some_method.assert_called_once()
```

### Explanation:

1. **Patch the Class**: `@patch('path.to.MyOtherClass')` tells the test to replace `MyOtherClass` with a mock object when `MyClass` is instantiated.

2. **Mock the Method**: `mock_instance.some_method.return_value = 100` sets the return value of the `some_method` to `100` when it is called within `MyClass`.

3. **Instantiating MyClass**: When you create an instance of `MyClass`, it will automatically use the mocked `MyOtherClass`, and `self.my_var` will be a mock object.

4. **Assertions**: You can then check if the method returns the expected value and verify that the mocked method was called as expected.

### Summary

By mocking the `MyOtherClass`, you effectively control the behavior of `self.my_var` within `MyClass`. This allows you to test `MyClass` in isolation without depending on the actual implementation of `MyOtherClass`.
