To mock a variable assignment within a function that is part of a class, you typically use the `patch` function from the `unittest.mock` module. The idea is to mock the expression or function call that assigns a value to the variable. This often involves mocking the function or object that produces the value assigned to the variable.

Let's walk through an example where a variable is assigned a value inside a function within a class.

### Example Scenario

Assume you have a class `MyClass` with a method `process_data` that assigns a value to a variable by calling an external function `calculate_value`.

### `external_module.py` (Standalone Function)

```python
# external_module.py

def calculate_value(input_data):
    # Imagine this function does some complex calculation
    return input_data * 2
```

### `my_module.py` (Class that Uses the Function)

```python
# my_module.py

from external_module import calculate_value

class MyClass:
    def process_data(self, data):
        # The variable `result` is assigned by calling the `calculate_value` function
        result = calculate_value(data)
        return result
```

### Unit Test Mocking the Variable Assignment

To mock the assignment of `result`, you can mock the `calculate_value` function to control what `result` is assigned in the `process_data` method.

```python
# test_my_module.py

import unittest
from unittest.mock import patch
from my_module import MyClass

class TestMyClass(unittest.TestCase):

    @patch('my_module.calculate_value', return_value=100)  # Mocking calculate_value to return 100
    def test_process_data_with_mocked_calculate_value(self, mock_calculate_value):
        # Instantiate the class
        obj = MyClass()

        # Call the method with some data
        result = obj.process_data(10)
        
        # Assert the results
        self.assertEqual(result, 100)  # Since we mocked calculate_value to return 100
        mock_calculate_value.assert_called_once_with(10)  # Check that calculate_value was called with 10

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

### Explanation:

1. **Mocking the Function Responsible for Assignment**:
   - The `@patch('my_module.calculate_value', return_value=100)` decorator is used to mock the `calculate_value` function that is responsible for assigning a value to the `result` variable within `process_data`.
   - Instead of performing the actual calculation, `calculate_value` will return `100` whenever it is called during this test.

2. **Testing the Assignment**:
   - In `test_process_data_with_mocked_calculate_value`, the `process_data(10)` method is called.
   - Since `calculate_value` is mocked to return `100`, the test asserts that `result` is equal to `100`.
   - The test also verifies that `calculate_value` was called exactly once with the argument `10`.

### Running the Test:

To run the test, execute:

```bash
python test_my_module.py
```

This test effectively mocks the assignment of the `result` variable by controlling the output of the function that provides its value (`calculate_value`). This approach can be applied whenever you need to mock an assignment within a method by targeting the function or operation that produces the value being assigned.
